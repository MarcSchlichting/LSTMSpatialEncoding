This Environment is dedicated to simulate a scenario with n drones, each starting at a random position (however observing some restriction like separation). The task of all the drones is to reach their randomly assigned target. The reward is based on the complete trajectory for each drone, hence the reward can only be given at the end of an episode. It is assumed that all drones operate under the same agent. Therefore larger numbers of drones allow for more stochastic relevant results. This coincident also reduces the computational power required to solve problem when using this environment with Online-Methods.
